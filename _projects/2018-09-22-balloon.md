In the early stages of our broadcast system design for WGBH[^1], we wanted to test a proof-of-concept that we had put together. We set out to run broadcast content from an unconventional input: a live, bird's-eye view of the "O" (the center of Olin's campus).

### Origins

The inspiration for the project was the balloon. We started with Public Lab's balloon mapping kit[^2], with the idea of using it to livestream video of the the O from above. Once we'd developed a proof-of-concept for our analog broadcast system, we decided to combine them in a live demo that tested both our broadcasting chops and our ability to create a compelling exhibit.

### Tech

For broadcasting, we used a simple version of our broadcast setup[^1], with just a single modulator, antenna, and TV. As the input to the modulator, we used our own custom livestreaming setup:

#### Livestreaming

We used a GoPro Hero 5, with a clip mount attached to a string that was tied around the balloon's loop. A mini battery pack, zip-tied to the camera, provided enough charge to broadcast for the time period that we needed. With a laptop connected to the GoPro's built-in wifi, a fork of the GoPro livestreaming script[^3] provided an easy way to start/stop streaming and recording.

### In the Air

At Olin's annual Alumni Weekend event, we deployed. With the help of a half-dozen other Olin students, we were able to successfully inflate the balloon using our game plan[^4], guiding it with three tethers attached to sandbags. After our successful deployment, we were able to successfully stream live footage of the O to our broadcast system and TV.
