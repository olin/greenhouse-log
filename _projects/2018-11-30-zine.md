As we (Evan and Matt) were heading to the first ever [New York Tech Zine Fair](http://techzinefair.org/) along with a group of Olin students, we wanted to create an informative zine as a way of communicating and documenting our project. Although our work has encompassed a number of different sub-projects, we chose to focus on conveying the things we learned throughout the process of building our low-power analog broadcast system. Over the course of a week, we designed printed *Hyperlocal TV: A Primer on Analog Broadcast.*

In total, we produced ~100 copies in two runs, half of which we brought to NYTZF and half of which we made for Expo as part of our end-of-the-semester exhibit of our work.
